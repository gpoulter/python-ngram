The NGram class extends the Python 'set' class with efficient
fuzzy search for members by means of an N-gram similarity measure.
It also has static methods to compare a pair of strings.

The N-grams are character based not word-based, and the class does not
implement a language model, merely searching for members by string similarity.

The `documentation`_ and `tutorial`_ are on the
PyPI package documentation site.

Installation
============

Install python-ngram from `PyPI`_ using `pip installer`_::

   pip install ngram

It should run on Python 2.6, Python 2.7 and Python 3.2

How does it work?
=================

The set stores arbitrary items, but for non-string items a `key` function
(such as `str`) must be specified to provide a string represenation.  The key
function can also be used to normalise string items (e.g. lower-casing) prior
to N-gram indexing.

To index a string it pads the string with a specified dummy character, then
splits it into overlapping substrings of N (default N=3) characters in length
and associates each N-gram to the items that use it.

To find items similar to a query string, it splits the query into N-grams,
collects all items sharing at least one N-gram with the query,
and ranks the items by score based on the ratio of shared to unshared
N-grams between strings.

History
=======

In 2007, Michel Albert (exhuma) wrote the python-ngram module based on Perl's
`String::Trigram`_ module by Tarek Ahmed, and committed the code for 2.0.0b2 to
a now-disused `Sourceforge`_ subversion repo.

Since late 2008, Graham Poulter has maintained python-ngram, initially refactoring
it to build on the `set` class, and also adding features, documentation, tests,
performance improvements and Python 3 support.

Primary development takes place on `GitHub`_, but changes are also pushed
to the earlier repo on `Google Code`_.
